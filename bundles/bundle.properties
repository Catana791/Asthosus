Its mineral-rich composition, now free of contaminants, offers the same thermal advantages as regular Oasis Water, including an increased boiling point and superior heat absorption properties. \nThe purity of the water makes it ideal for delicate and precise machinery, such as cooling systems for reactors and turbines, where even trace contaminants could lead to failure. \nDespite its enhanced purity, Purified Oasis Water remains as scarce as its unfiltered counterpart, requiring careful management in any operation. \n\n- Trumir Resource Analysis Report No.19

status.asthosus-26z-20-liquid-tablet-liquid-barite.name = Resource Entry - Liquid Barite
status.asthosus-26z-20-liquid-tablet-liquid-barite.description = Location: \n Liquid Barite is a highly unstable, radioactive form of Barite, only found in the most extreme conditions. \nThis fluid form is capable of spreading quickly and causing damage to anything it comes into contact with. Its caustic nature and the radiation it emits make it one of the most dangerous liquids on Asthosus. \nHowever, when cooled and processed through a Barite Cooler, Liquid Barite can be hardened back into solid Barite, a useful material for advanced building and crafting. \n\nComposition: \nLiquid Barite retains many of the properties of its solid counterpart, but in a more unstable, liquid state. \nIts high radioactivity makes it extremely dangerous to handle, and it emits a faint but persistent radiation field. Anything that comes into contact with Liquid Barite becomes exposed to this radiation and is damaged as a result. \nIts high viscosity and explosiveness make it a potential hazard in large quantities.
status.asthosus-26z-20-liquid-tablet-liquid-barite.details = Entry R-020: Liquid Barite Hazard Report \n\nLiquid Barite presents a significant threat to equipment due to its high volatility and the radiation it emits. \nWhen not properly contained, it will spread across the environment, causing extensive damage. The substance is difficult to manage, but with the correct cooling processes in place, it can be solidified back into Barite and used as a resource for advanced construction and defense systems. \nHowever, the process of safely handling Liquid Barite requires specialized equipment, such as Barite Coolers, which are necessary for its transformation into a usable state. \n\n- Trumir Resource Analysis Report No.20

status.asthosus-26z-21-liquid-tablet-nontragen.description = Location: \nNontragen is a sophisticated and highly specialized gas, produced through a unique process that involves pressurizing Oasis Water and Powderized Obsidian. \nThis gas plays a crucial role in advanced cooling systems and high-tech production processes on Asthosus. Its unique properties make it invaluable for high-efficiency applications, particularly in environments where extreme temperatures are a challenge. \nNontragen is recognized for its thermal stability, which allows it to serve as a powerful coolant in systems requiring constant, regulated temperatures. \n\nComposition: \nNontragen is a gas with a distinct thermal signature, making it a critical component in managing the heat generated by advanced machinery and facilities on the planet. \nThe synthesis process, which involves the combination of Oasis Water and Powderized Obsidian under intense pressure, results in a gas with impressive heat capacity and a stable cooling effect. It can withstand high temperatures and regulate cooling in systems that would otherwise be vulnerable to overheating. \nThe unique mixture of ingredients gives Nontragen a subtle but noticeable color and texture, a distinguishing factor for working with it.
status.asthosus-26z-21-liquid-tablet-nontragen.details = Entry R-021: Nontragen Synthesis Report \n\nThe synthesis of Nontragen is a delicate process, requiring precise control of temperature and pressure. \nIts applications in high-end production systems are invaluable, especially in environments such as the Radiant Expanse and the Igneous Biome, where extreme heat is a constant threat. \nThe gas serves as a highly effective coolant, particularly for advanced machinery and reactors that require constant cooling under high-stress conditions. Furthermore, Nontragen's role in advanced production methods, particularly in the creation of high-tech alloys and materials, cannot be overstated. \n\n- Trumir Resource Analysis Report No.21
