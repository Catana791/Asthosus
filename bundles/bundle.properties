mod.asthosus.description = A mod that adds a new planet, Asthosus, into the game.\n\nAsthosus is a deserted planet. A wasteland filled with danger.\nIt has a fully playable campaign with 11 campaign and 21 optional maps.\n\nAside from these 32 maps, Asthosus contains over 180 pieces of unique content,\nincluding blocks, liquids, items, units and status effects.\nThis number is not counting any internal units or environment blocks/tiles.\n\nI aimed to re-use nearly no vanilla content and instead\nfill the mod with new and (hopefully) exciting things.\n\nThe mod comes with it's own custom music, made by ThePythonGuy3!\n\nIf you find any issues or want to tell me anything else,\nfeel free to join the Asthosus Discord server. \nThe same thing goes for when you need help with this mod.\nEnjoy!
mod.asthosus.subtitle = Now with 60% more sand!
