mod.asthosus.description = A mod that adds a new planet, Asthosus, into the game.\n\nAsthosus is a deserted planet. A wasteland filled with danger.\nIt has a fully playable campaign with 11 campaign and 21 optional maps.\n\nAside from these 32 maps, Asthosus contains over 180 pieces of unique content,\nincluding blocks, liquids, items, units and status effects.\nThis number is not counting any internal units or environment blocks/tiles.\n\nI aimed to re-use nearly no vanilla content and instead\nfill the mod with new and (hopefully) exciting things.\n\nThe mod comes with it's own custom music, made by ThePythonGuy3!\n\nIf you find any issues or want to tell me anything else,\nfeel free to join the Asthosus Discord server. \nThe same thing goes for when you need help with this mod.\nEnjoy!
mod.asthosus.subtitle = Now with 65% more sand!

status.asthosus-25y-06-memorial-recording-6.details = Because of the great success of terraforming Trecara, one of Asthosus oceans \nwas attempted to be terraformed into liveable terrain to fuel the fire \nthat was the expansion of the planets people.\n\nWhile this experiment was in progress, \na solar wind discharge erupted from the sun.\nLuckily, the force generator installed on Trecara was able to deflect most of \nit and prevent further damage. Or so the Asthosians thought...

status.asthosus-25y-07-memorial-recording-7.details = A large part of the flare's solar energy managed to bypass the force shield, \ndirectly striking the terraforming devices on both Asthosus and Trecara.\n\nThe machines went out of control and threatened to destroy a major part of the Asthosian civilization.\n\nLuckily, though, the best scientists were able to avoid this catastrophy by \nlaunching the terraforming devices into outer space, last minute, where they exploded.\n\nThis mishap was the final straw the Arumis party needed to finally \ngain control and take power over Asthosus.

status.asthosus-25y-08-memorial-recording-8.details = A few hundred years went by, Asthosus and Trecara were still thriving.\nMost of the people who witnessed the incident had already died of old age \nor other causes.\n\nBecause of the Arumis gaining power, the outpost on Trecara was abandoned, \nrendering the force projector that had been protecting Asthosus no longer functional.

status.asthosus-25y-09-memorial-recording-9.details = The Arumis made sure to create weapons capable of mass destruction, should \nanyone come to threaten Asthosus and its people.\n\nOne day, as a result of another planets experiments, a devastating \ngeomagnetic storm was released from the sun.\n\nThe storm hit Trecara first, disabling the final pieces of infrastructure \nthat were still running to protect Asthosus.

status.asthosus-25y-10-memorial-recording-10.details = Scientists rushed to reinstate the devices on Trecara and Asthosus, \nstarting with the one on Asthosus surface.\n\nWhile working on this device, it ruptured in a disastrous explosion, taking \ndown multiple major cities nearby. To make things worse, it also hit the storage \nfacility for the most powerful weapons of mass destruction.\n\nMillions of civilians died in great agony, be it from the heat of the explosion \nor the emitted viruses from the biological weapons.

status.asthosus-25y-11-memorial-recording-11.details = Because of these two major catastrophes, Asthosus atmosphere \nwas almost completely destroyed.\nAs a consequence, temperatures on Asthosus rose slowly \nbut constantly, with nothing the Asthosians could do to stop it.\n\nAt some point, all attempts at saving Asthosus, or, to be precise \nits people, were futile.\nThe planets entire population was wiped out by the extreme heat.\n\nAsthosus fate had taken its course.

status.asthosus-26z-01-item-tablet-ferrinite.description = Location: \nThe Barrens, a biome on Asthosus where conditions are relatively stable compared to the rest of the planet. \nThis area is defined by vast stretches of quicksand floors, lignite deposits, geothermal vents and the remains of dead plant life. \nWhile it's not free from hazards, the Barrens offer a much safer environment for initial operation. \n\nComposition: \nFerrinite is a rock-like material, formed from the natural fusion of sand and mineral deposits. \nThe intense heat that is present on Asthosus hardened the material into a dense, stone-like substance, making it a useful resource for early construction.
status.asthosus-26z-01-item-tablet-ferrinite.details = Entry R-001: Ferrinite Material Report \n\nFerrinite is one of the most abundant materials found within the Barrens, a biome that, depsirte its dry and barren nature, offers a stable environment copared to other more volatile and hostile regions of Asthosus. \nThe combination of geothermal vents and lignite deposits has led to the formation of this rock-like material, a fusion of sand and minerals that was hardened over time. \nWhile Ferrinite's low hardness makes it unsuitable for use in more advanced or long-term construction, it is invaluable for the initial stages of base-building. \nIts relative abundance and ease of extraction allows for the quick establishment of operations. \nAs the resources grow and more durable materials become available, Ferrinite will be phased out in favor or stronger alternatives. \nBut it does appear that it will continue to be of use even in more complex structures. \n\n- Trumir Resource Analysis Report
