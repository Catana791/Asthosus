This filtration process removes impurities, leaving the water in a pristine state ideal for technical applications. \nWhile still maintaining its high mineral concentration, Purified Oasis Water is now free from the natural contaminants present in raw Oasis Water. Its improved composition enhances its use as a superior coolant and makes it more effective in delicate machinery or advanced systems that require a higher level of purity.
status.asthosus-26z-19-liquid-tablet-purified-water.details = Entry R-019: Purified Oasis Water Application Report \n\nPurified Oasis Water is an invaluable resource, filtered to meet the stringent requirements for use in advanced machinery and high-tech applications. Its mineral-rich composition, now free of contaminants, offers the same thermal advantages as regular Oasis Water, including an increased boiling point and superior heat absorption properties. \nThe purity of the water makes it ideal for delicate and precise machinery, such as cooling systems for reactors and turbines, where even trace contaminants could lead to failure. \nDespite its enhanced purity, Purified Oasis Water remains as scarce as its unfiltered counterpart, requiring careful management in any operation. \n\n- Trumir Resource Analysis Report No.19

status.asthosus-26z-20-liquid-tablet-liquid-barite.description = Location: \n Liquid Barite is a highly unstable, radioactive form of Barite, only found in the most extreme conditions. \nThis fluid form is capable of spreading quickly and causing damage to anything it comes into contact with. Its caustic nature and the radiation it emits make it one of the most dangerous liquids on Asthosus. \nHowever, when cooled and processed through a Barite Cooler, Liquid Barite can be hardened back into solid Barite, a useful material for advanced building and crafting. \n\nComposition: \nLiquid Barite retains many of the properties of its solid counterpart, but in a more unstable, liquid state. \nIts high radioactivity makes it extremely dangerous to handle, and it emits a faint but persistent radiation field. Anything that comes into contact with Liquid Barite becomes exposed to this radiation and is damaged as a result. \nIts high viscosity and explosiveness make it a potential hazard in large quantities.
status.asthosus-26z-20-liquid-tablet-liquid-barite.details = Entry R-020: Liquid Barite Hazard Report \n\nLiquid Barite presents a significant threat to equipment due to its high volatility and the radiation it emits. \nWhen not properly contained, it will spread across the environment, causing extensive damage. The substance is difficult to manage, but with the correct cooling processes in place, it can be solidified back into Barite and used as a resource for advanced construction and defense systems. \nHowever, the process of safely handling Liquid Barite requires specialized equipment, such as Barite Coolers, which are necessary for its transformation into a usable state. \n\n- Trumir Resource Analysis Report No.20
